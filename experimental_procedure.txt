- Welcome to the experiment 

- We will test difference ways of encoding information

- You will write a series of words in two different ways

- The computer will instruct you when to use each one

- The 2 ways of writing are normal and mirrored 

- Using the name "Sam" we will demonstrate these 2 ways 

- If you are instructed to write normally you write *...DEMONSTRATE *

- If you are instructed to write mirrored write *...DEMONSTRATE* 

- In mirrored writing you will keep the order of the letters the same, but write the letters themselves mirrored

- You will first do a practice phase where you do each method on the same name

- Write all letters non-cursive and small cap allways and with your dominant hand

- When you have written the word, you can press SPACE to move on to the next word.

- You will get a maximum time to write each word, if the time runs out a beep tone will play indicating you to stop and get ready for the next word. 

- If you are not finished with writing the word before times runs out you should just move on to next one 

- Before writing the next word you will remove the sticker note or paper you just wrote and take a new one for the next word 

- After each phase you will do a task, the computer will instruct you what to do 

- After the task you will do a memory test on how many words you remembered. 

- You will write these on a piece of paper we give you 

- A sound will play when the test is over. You will then turn the paper upside down to your left, and then begin the next round.

- You will repeat the whole process of writing a number of words, followed by a task and recall test 6 times in total 

- The screen will contain proper instructions for you 

- Are there any question ?
